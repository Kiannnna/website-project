    <h1>TYPES OF MAHJONG SETS</h1>

    <h2>Suited tiles</h2>
    <h3>
      Suited tiles are divided into three suits and each are numbered from 1 to
      9. The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are four identical
      copies of each suited tile totaling 108 tiles. The bamboo suit is
      alsoknown as "sticks", "strings" or "bams" suit; the first tile usually
      has a bird (traditionally, a peacock or sparrow) instead of a single
      bamboo. The dots suit is also known as the "wheels", "circles", "coins",
      "stones", "marbles" or "balls" suit. The characters suit is also known as
      the "myriads", "cracks" or "numbers" suit since the top characters are
      numbers in the Chinese orthography, and the bottom characters (in
      traditional Chinese characters) are the Chinese orthography of "ten
      thousand".

    <h2>Honors tiles</h2>
    <h3>
      There are two different sets of honors tiles: winds and dragons. The winds
      are east, south, west, and north, beginning with east. The dragons are
      red, green, and white. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the
      face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank. These tiles have no
      numerical sequence like the suited tiles (for example the bamboo pieces
      number 1 to 9). Like the suited tiles, there are four identical copies of
      each honors tile, for a total of 28 honors tiles.

    <h2>Bonus tiles</h2>
    <h3>
      There are two sets of bonus tiles: flowers and seasons. The flower and
      season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn,
      the bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside
      and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they
      win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the bonus tile.
      In addition, unlike the suited and honours tiles, there is only a single
      tile of each bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four
      season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of
      a specific type of flower or season.
